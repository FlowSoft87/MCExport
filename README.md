# MCExport
A blender plugin to create and export 3D models for Minecraft modding.

Installation:
1) Put the MCExport folder into the addons folder of your blender script path.
Then navigate to 'File > User Preferences > Add-ons' and activate the "Minecraft cube-exporter" addon.
2) To get the typical Minecraft look uncheck the option "Mipmaps" in 'File > User Preferences > System'.
Do not forget to save the changes if you want them to be permanent.

Usage:
The addon provides buttons for the following three actions:
- Add a new box mesh to the model.
- Set the UV layout of the currently active box model.
- Export the whole model as a .java class that Minecraft can use directly.
